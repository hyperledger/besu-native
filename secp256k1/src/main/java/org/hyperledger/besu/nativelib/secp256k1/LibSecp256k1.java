   * is done by negating the S value modulo the order of the curve, 'flipping'
   * the sign of the random point R which is not included in the signature.
   *
   * <p>Forgery of the same message isn't universally problematic, but in systems
   * where message malleability or uniqueness of signatures is important this can
   * cause issues. This forgery can be blocked by all verifiers forcing signers
   * to use a normalized form.
   *
   * <p>The lower-S form reduces the size of signatures slightly on average when

   *

   * there is no formal proof that ECDSA, even with this additional restriction,
   * is free of other malleability. Commonly used serialization schemes will also
   * accept various non-unique encodings, so care should be taken when this
   * property is required for an application.
